# encrypt a file as a zip: https://askubuntu.com/questions/342900/compressing-folders-with-password-via-command-line
zip -er F.zip F

# This will prompt you for a password. Give it, and that will create a password-protected zip file from that folder.
# -e enables encryption for your zip file. This is what makes it ask for the password.    -r makes the command recursive, meaning that all the files inside the folder will be added to the zip file.

# F is the folder you want to zip. It is located where you're currently are when you type the command
